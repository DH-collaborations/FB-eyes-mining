On Septem er 19, l963, a confidential source who

has furnished reliable infprmatignmin the past, advised that

on that date Clarence Jones (Counsel“t6'Martin Luther King)

and James Baldwin (Negro author) held a discussion regarding
Baldwin's appearance on the USIA_television program in
Washington on August 28, 1963. ‘Jone stated that he had .L
requested from USIA a transcript of he entire show and had
received this transcript and noted that Baldwin's,remarks
regarding the Federal Bureau of Investigatigp_(FBI) and Mr.Hoover
were not contained therein and therefore=Jones,assumed that
these remarks had been edited out. Baldwin stated that he

had witnesses to the statements that he had made on this
program. In recalling his statement regarding the FBI,

Baldwin stated that the substance of his remarks on this h~
program were "part of the problem in the civil rights my
movement is J. Edgar Hoover". Jones.then stated that he

would "like to blow the whistle on this". Jone-,stated‘_ c

that any legitimate critical opinion of the FB his apparently
Foff limits or taboo". Jongs further stated that he had
composed a letter to the rest of the participants on the USIA
show informing them of the deletionamade. Jones_then stated
that he intends to inform the USIA that he kn6ws'of the deletion
and intends also to bring this informatiogptppthe attention

of the public and the Attorney General. ;jon§s continued that
he was going to do this imediately and stated that he would
also like ta draft a statement and stated "we cannot let this
deletion go..' —

Additionally, Baldwin and Jones'd1scussed Baldwin's
public statement of September 18, 1963, issued at a press
conference in New York City. According to the “New York
Herald Tribune", September 19, 1963, Baldwin is quoted as
bitterly criticizing the Kennedy Administration and the FBI
for their "lack of action" following the Birmingham bombing,
September 15, 1963. The "New York Times" of September 19,

1963, additionally quotes Baldwin as saying "I blame J. Edgar
Hoover in part for events in Alabama. Negroes have no cause Mgg_
to have faith in the FBI". This source also stated that Jones.,
told Baldwin that he had received a call from an attorney

"who works in an office of the Justice Department". According
to this source, this attorney advised Jones that Baldwin's
statement had caused "quite a stir", stating further "youire
going to be hearing from us". .

Jones further advised Baldwin that Baldwiggs press
statements were a most significant contribution. f3bnes further
stated that he was-disturbed over the proposed conference of
Ne ro leaders with the President scheduled for September l9,
l9 3. '3ones felt-that this conference could do more harm than
good. Baldwin stated that he felt that Kennedy should go to
Alabama and Jones replied "the President cannot be let off
the hook on this‘thing". fJ;ﬂW‘ further added that Baldwin's
press statement had been a"‘ valuable contribution and that
it reflected that general consensus of opinion of the majority
of Negroes in Birmingham. Baldwin agreed that the feeling
existed not only in Brmingham but elsewhere. Baldwin then
spoke of something his sister had said to his mother, "Negroes
are thinking seriously of assassinating Martin Luther King".
Jones then stated that he believed that the feeling in the
South is one of "crisis in the efficacy of non~violent movement".

. $7 In a further discussion of the Birmingham bombing
dongs questioned the "efficacy of the FBI in cases like this".
Jong§’stated that there had been #5 to 50 bombings since

l947 and not one had been solved. He further stated that
"there has‘been a total absence of RBI infiltrating

racist organizations“. - ,

Cited as a Communist front which ‘is

making special appeals in behalf of civil

Among these organizations are the * * *
